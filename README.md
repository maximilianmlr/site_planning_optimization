<h2>Optimizing Facility Location using Heuristic Algorithms</h2>

This project aims to address the challenging problem of facility location planning in business settings. It implements and compares four algorithms: Add-Heuristic, Drop-Heuristic, Simulated Annealing, and Late Acceptance Hillclimber. These algorithms aim to minimize the total costs, including fixed and variable costs, while considering factors like demand, transportation costs, and facility opening/closure decisions. The project provides implementations of these algorithms and conducts a computational study to compare their performance in terms of solution quality and computational time for various problem instances.
